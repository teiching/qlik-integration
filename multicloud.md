# Multi-Cloud
Using your existing QlikView or Qlik Sense Client Managed deployment along with Qlik Sense Enterprise on SaaS will enable you to bring everything together in a multi-cloud environment, making the most of your existing components and migrating entirely to SaaS at some point.
This page will provide you with some information about the most common multi-cloud scenarios and also provide you with some best-practize guidance on how to approach the migration to a full SaaS solution.

## Migrating to Qlik Sense SaaS
Migrating to Qlik Cloud from your on-premis Qlik system is a journey that requires some [planning](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/migration/Content/Migration/qliksense-qliksense-planning-your-migration.htm "Planning your migration to Qlik Cloud") in advance. Here are some steps that you should perform as part of your planning process:

* Run an assessment of your current system to collect information and metrics that facilitate the planning process, e.g. How many apps do you have? What are their usage metrics? What datasources are you currently using in you analytics apps and how can these be made available for consumption in the cloud?
* Define your strategic direction for moving your analytics to the cloud based on your business needs.

As shown in the diagram below, the detailed assessment should be the starting point in our recommended phased approach. After that you can start offloading the consumption of your analytic apps into Qlik Cloud, followed by creating the data pipeline that moves your on-premise data to the cloud as well until you reach the state of Active Intelligence where the Qlik Cloud capabilities actively support you in making informed decisions.
